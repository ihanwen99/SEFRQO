## now help me solve this question, just *ONLY* output the sequences like the example, no other output:
# You have these tables with different alias:
title as t
kind_type as kt
info_type as it1
movie_info as mi1
movie_info as mi2
info_type as it2
cast_info as ci
role_type as rt
name as n
movie_keyword as mk
keyword as k

# table cardinality = {  
        'cast_info': 36244344,
        'info_type': 113,
        'keyword': 134170,
        'kind_type': 7,
        'movie_info': 14835720,
        'movie_keyword': 4523930,
        'name': 4167491,
        'role_type': 12,
        'title': 2528312,
    }

# filter cardinality ={
    ('info_type AS it1', '(it1.id = 8)'): 1
    ('info_type AS it2', '(it2.id = 6)'): 1
    ('movie_info AS mi1', "((mi1.info_type_id = 8) AND (mi1.info = ANY ('{Austria,Belgium,Brazil,Hungary,India,Mexico,Poland,Spain}'::text[])))"): 11141
    ('movie_info AS mi2', "((mi2.info = ANY ('{Mono,Silent}'::text[])) AND (mi2.info_type_id = 6))"): 10224
    ('kind_type AS kt', '((kt.kind)::text = ANY (\'{episode,movie,"tv movie"}\'::text[]))'): 3
    ('role_type AS rt', '((rt.role)::text = ANY (\'{"costume designer","production designer"}\'::text[]))'): 2
    ('name AS n', '(n.gender IS NULL)'): 1455873
    ('title AS t', '((t.production_year <= 1975) AND (t.production_year >= 1875))'): 450516
    ('keyword AS k', "(k.keyword = ANY ('{based-on-play,cigarette-smoking,friendship,independent-film,jealousy,lesbian-sex,male-nudity,marriage,mother-daughter-relationship,one-word-title,oral-sex,police,singing,song}'::text[]))"): 14
}
