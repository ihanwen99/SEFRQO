### reasoning ###
Okay, let's try to figure out the best way to join all these tables. The goal is to create an efficient query plan by choosing the right scan types (IndexScan or SeqScan) and join methods (HashJoin, NestLoop, MergeJoin) while respecting the order of operations.

First, I need to look at the tables and their cardinalities, as well as the filter cardinalities provided. The tables involved are title as t, kind_type as kt, info_type as it1 and it2, movie_info as mi1 and mi2, cast_info as ci, role_type as rt, name as n, movie_keyword as mk, and keyword as k.

Starting with the filter cardinalities, some tables have very selective filters. For example, info_type it1 and it2 each have a filter that reduces them to 1 row. Similarly, role_type rt is filtered down to 2 rows. These small tables might be good candidates to pick early and join with larger tables.

Looking at the tables with filters:

- it1 has a filter (it1.id = 8) with cardinality 1.

- it2 has (it2.id = 6) also 1 row.

- mi1 has a filter that leaves 11,141 rows.

- mi2 has 10,224 rows.

- kt (kind_type) filtered to 3 rows.

- rt (role_type) to 2 rows.

- n (name) has a filter (n.gender IS NULL) resulting in 1,455,873 rows.

- t (title) filtered to 450,516 rows.

- k (keyword) filtered to 14 rows.

The largest tables are cast_info (36M) and movie_info (14.8M), but their filtered versions (mi1, mi2) are smaller. The keyword and movie_keyword are also significant but mk has 4.5M and keyword 134k, but k is filtered to 14.

I think the strategy here is to start with the smallest filtered tables first because joining smaller tables early can reduce the amount of data carried through subsequent joins.

So maybe start with it1 and it2, but since they are info_type, they might be joined with movie_info (mi1 and mi2). For example, mi1 has info_type_id=8 (it1), so joining mi1 with it1 early makes sense. Similarly, mi2 has info_type_id=6 (it2), so mi2 and it2 could be joined early.

Also, the role_type rt has only 2 rows, and cast_info ci is a big table, but if we can filter ci with rt early, that might help. Similarly, name n has a filter of 1.4M rows, which is still large, but maybe after joining with ci (cast_info) which has a filter on note, but wait, in this problem's filter cardinality, there's a filter on name AS n with (n.gender IS NULL) resulting in 1,455,873 rows. Wait, but in the given filter cardinality, I don't see a filter for cast_info here. The example had a filter on ci.note, but in this problem, the filters listed are for it1, it2, mi1, mi2, kt, rt, n, t, and k. So cast_info (ci) doesn't have a filter here, which means we have to scan the entire 36M rows unless there's a join condition that reduces it. Hmm, that's a problem. But maybe ci is joined with rt (role_type) which has a filter to 2 rows. So if we join ci with rt early, that might reduce ci's rows by role_type.role being costume designer or production designer. So ci has a role_id that matches rt.id, and since rt is filtered to 2 rows, that could reduce ci's size. Similarly, name n is filtered to 1.4M, but if we join ci (cast_info) with n on person_id, maybe that can reduce the size.

So possible starting points:

1. Pick the small filtered tables like it1, it2, rt, kt, k, and then join them with their related larger tables.

Let me list the tables and their filtered sizes:

- it1: 1

- it2: 1

- rt: 2

- kt: 3

- k:14

- mi1: 11k

- mi2:10k

- t:450k

- n:1.4M

- mk:4.5M (no filter, but maybe joined with k which has 14 rows)

- ci:36M (no filter, but joined with rt and n)

- mi1 and mi2 are already filtered.

So perhaps start by joining the smallest filtered tables with their related larger tables. For example:

- Join mi1 with it1 (since mi1.info_type_id = it1.id and it1 has id=8). Since it1 is only 1 row, this can be a quick join. Similarly, mi2 with it2.

Then, maybe join ci with rt (role_type) to reduce ci's size. Then join ci with n (name) which is 1.4M rows. Then join title t with kind_type kt (assuming t.kind_id = kt.id and kt is filtered to 3 rows). Then, movie_keyword mk with keyword k (mk.keyword_id = k.id, k has 14 rows). Then combine all these.

But the challenge is the order. Let's think step by step.

First, decide which tables to pick first. Since it1 and it2 are very small, maybe pick them first. However, they need to be joined with mi1 and mi2. So perhaps pick mi1 and mi2 first, but mi1 has a filter that reduces it to 11k rows. So maybe pick mi1 and it1 first.

Alternatively, pick it1 (1 row) and then join with mi1. Similarly for it2 and mi2.

But the problem requires that tables must be picked before being joined. So for each table, we need to pick them first with a scan (Index or Seq), then join.

So for mi1, the filter is on info_type_id=8 and info in certain countries. The info_type_id=8 corresponds to it1. So maybe pick it1 first (since it's 1 row), then mi1 as IndexScan if possible. Wait, but mi1 has a filter on info_type_id=8 and info in a list. If there's an index on mi1.info_type_id and info, then IndexScan would be better. Alternatively, if the filter on mi1 is selective enough (11k out of 14M), an IndexScan might be better than a SeqScan. Similarly for mi2.

Similarly, for mi2, the filter is info_type_id=6 (it2) and info in Mono/Silent. So it2 is 1 row, and mi2's filter reduces it to 10k.

So possible steps:

1. Pick it1 (SeqScan, since it's 1 row), then pick mi1 with IndexScan (since info_type_id=8 and info in a list). Join them as MergeJoin or HashJoin. But MergeJoin requires sorted inputs. If there's an index on mi1.info_type_id, then IndexScan would be ordered, so MergeJoin might be possible. But maybe the planner would use HashJoin here.

But according to the example, sometimes they use NestLoop even with larger tables. But in the example, they used a NestLoop for joining n (172 rows) and ci (2.4M), which seems expensive, but maybe because of indexes.

Alternatively, maybe start with the largest filtered tables first. Wait, but the example started with n (172) and ci (2.4M). Hmm.

Alternatively, the example started with the name and cast_info, which were filtered, then joined with title. Maybe the strategy is to start with the tables that have the most selective filters to reduce the rows early.

In this case, the most selective are it1, it2, rt, kt, k, etc. So perhaps start with it1 and it2, then mi1 and mi2.

Let me try to outline possible steps:

1. Pick it1 (1 row) as SeqScan.

2. Pick mi1 (11k) as IndexScan (if possible, given the filter on info_type_id and info).

3. Join it1 and mi1 using HashJoin or MergeJoin.

4. Similarly for it2 and mi2.

But perhaps first handle the tables that can be joined in pairs.

Another approach is to build subtrees for each pair and then combine them.

Alternatively, consider that title t has a filter of 450k rows. Title is connected to movie_info (mi1, mi2), movie_keyword (mk), and cast_info (ci). So joining t with these tables.

But maybe start with the smallest subtrees first.

Let me think of possible join pairs:

- mi1 with it1 (mi1.info_type_id = it1.id)

- mi2 with it2 (mi2.info_type_id = it2.id)

- mk with k (mk.keyword_id = k.id)

- t with kt (t.kind_id = kt.id)

- ci with rt (ci.role_id = rt.id)

- ci with n (ci.person_id = n.id)

So building these pairs first.

Now, the order in which to process these pairs.

Starting with the smallest ones first:

- it1 (1) and mi1 (11k)

- it2 (1) and mi2 (10k)

- rt (2) and ci (36M) â†’ but joining rt (2 rows) with ci (36M) would result in ci rows where role_id is in the filtered rt (2 roles). But without a filter on ci, this could be 36M * 2/12 (since role_type has 12 total, but filtered to 2). That's 6M rows. Still large, but maybe better than 36M.

Alternatively, if we can join ci with rt and n, perhaps that reduces it further. But n has 1.4M rows, so joining ci (after rt) with n would be 6M rows joined with 1.4M, which could be expensive.

Alternatively, start with the smallest possible joins.

Another thing: the keyword k (14 rows) and movie_keyword mk (4.5M). Joining mk with k would result in 4.5M * 14/134k (since k has 14 rows out of 134k). But 14/134k is about 0.01%, so 4.5M * 0.01% = ~450 rows. Wait, but that's if the distribution is even. If the keyword filter selects 14 specific keywords, and mk has entries for those, then mk joined with k would be mk rows where keyword_id is in those 14. Assuming uniform distribution, but maybe it's more. The filter on k is 14 rows, so mk joined with k would have 14 * (mk's rows per keyword). If each keyword has around 4.5M / 134k â‰ˆ 33.6 rows per keyword, then 14 * 33.6 â‰ˆ 470 rows. That's a small number. So joining mk with k early would reduce mk from 4.5M to ~470 rows. That's a huge reduction. So that's a good candidate to do early.

So maybe pick k first (14 rows, SeqScan or IndexScan?), then mk (4.5M). Join them with HashJoin or NestLoop. Since k is small, HashJoin would be efficient.

So possible steps:

1. Pick k (14 rows) as SeqScan.

2. Pick mk (4.5M) as IndexScan if there's an index on keyword_id.

3. Join k and mk as HashJoin.

That would create a subtree (k mk) with ~470 rows.

Then, this subtree can be joined with title t (450k rows) on mk.movie_id = t.id. That would reduce t's rows to those that have the keywords in k. But since mk after join is 470 rows, joining with t would result in 470 rows (assuming each mk entry points to one title). So this would be a small subtree.

This seems very beneficial. So starting with k and mk.

Similarly, for the other pairs:

- it1 and mi1 â†’ mi1 is 11k rows.

- it2 and mi2 â†’ 10k rows.

- rt and ci â†’ 6M rows (maybe).

- n and ci â†’ after joining ci with rt, then joining with n (1.4M rows).

But the challenge is to decide the order.

Another approach is to build the smallest possible subtrees first and then join them in a way that minimizes the total cost.

So let's try to outline the steps:

1. Pick k (keyword) with SeqScan (since it's 14 rows, SeqScan is fine).

2. Pick mk (movie_keyword) with IndexScan on keyword_id (since we're joining on k.id = mk.keyword_id, and k is 14 rows, so mk can use an index to find rows with keyword_id in those 14). This would quickly find the relevant mk rows.

3. Join k and mk with HashJoin (since k is small, build a hash table on k.id and probe mk.keyword_id).

4. Now we have a subtree (k mk) with ~470 rows.

Next, join this with title t. Since t has a filter of 450k rows, but joining with mk.movie_id = t.id would only include titles that have the keywords in k. So:

5. Pick t (title) with SeqScan (since the filter reduces it to 450k, but maybe an index on production_year could help, but not sure. Alternatively, if there's an index on t.id for the join, but since we're joining with mk.movie_id, which is 470 rows, a HashJoin might be better. So pick t as SeqScan.

6. Join (k mk) with t as HashJoin, resulting in a subtree ((k mk) t) with ~470 rows (assuming each mk entry points to one t).

Then, handle the kind_type kt, which has a filter of 3 rows. Since t.kind_id = kt.id, and kt is filtered to 3 rows:

7. Pick kt (kind_type) with SeqScan (3 rows).

8. Join ((k mk) t) with kt as HashJoin, since kt is small. Now the subtree includes kind_type, reducing t to those with kind in episode, movie, tv movie. But t was already filtered to 450k, but after joining with k mk and kt, maybe the rows are around 470 * 3/7 (since kind_type has 7 total, but 3 are selected). Wait, but t's kind_id is already part of the join, so after joining with kt, the rows would be those t rows that have the keywords and the correct kind. Assuming all 470 t rows have the correct kind, then it remains 470. So this join may not reduce further.

But maybe the order should be to join t with kt first, then with mk and k. Let's think: t has 450k rows. Join with kt (3 rows) would reduce t to 450k * 3/7 â‰ˆ 192k rows. Then join with mk and k. But that might not be as effective as joining with mk first. So perhaps the initial approach is better.

Continuing:

Now the subtree is (((k mk) t) kt). Next, handle mi1 and it1:

9. Pick it1 (info_type) with SeqScan (1 row).

10. Pick mi1 (movie_info) with IndexScan on info_type_id and info (since the filter is info_type_id=8 and info in a list). If an index exists on (info_type_id, info), this would be efficient. The result is 11k rows.

11. Join it1 with mi1 as HashJoin or MergeJoin. Since it1 is 1 row, HashJoin is efficient. Result is (it1 mi1) with 11k rows.

Now, this subtree needs to be joined with the existing subtree. How? mi1 is linked to t via movie_id. So ((k mk) t) is connected to mi1 on t.id = mi1.movie_id. So:

12. Join (((k mk) t) kt) with (it1 mi1) on t.id = mi1.movie_id. Since ((k mk) t) has ~470 rows, and mi1 has 11k rows, this join would result in 470 * (11k / total t rows). But since t is already filtered, maybe each t row has multiple mi1 entries. But if mi1 is filtered to 11k rows, and t is 470, then the join would be 470 rows (each t row may have multiple mi1 entries, but assuming mi1.movie_id is unique? Unlikely. So this could be more. But if the join is on t.id = mi1.movie_id, and t has 470 rows, and mi1 has 11k rows, but only those where movie_id is in t's 470. So the number of rows would be the number of mi1 rows where movie_id is in those 470 t rows. If each t has on average 11k / 2528312 (original t rows) â‰ˆ 0.0043 mi1 rows. But after filtering, maybe higher. But this is speculative. Regardless, joining the 470-row subtree with 11k mi1 rows would likely be done via HashJoin or NestLoop. If the subtree is small, NestLoop might be feasible, but HashJoin is more likely.

So step 12: Join (((k mk) t) kt) with (it1 mi1) as HashJoin.

Resulting subtree: ((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)).

Next, handle mi2 and it2:

13. Pick it2 (info_type) with SeqScan (1 row).

14. Pick mi2 (movie_info) with IndexScan on info_type_id=6 and info in {Mono,Silent}, resulting in 10k rows.

15. Join it2 with mi2 as HashJoin. Now subtree (it2 mi2).

This needs to be joined with the existing subtree. mi2 is connected to t via movie_id as well. So:

16. Join (((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) with (it2 mi2) on t.id = mi2.movie_id. Again, similar to mi1, this would add mi2 info for the same t rows. So using HashJoin.

Now, handling cast_info ci, role_type rt, and name n:

17. Pick rt (role_type) with SeqScan (2 rows).

18. Pick ci (cast_info) with SeqScan (36M rows, but no filter). However, joining ci with rt (role_id = rt.id) would reduce ci to those with role_id in the 2 filtered roles. So:

19. Join rt and ci as HashJoin (rt is small, build hash on rt.id, probe ci.role_id). Resulting in ci rows with role_id in the 2 roles. Assuming uniform distribution, 36M * 2/12 = 6M rows.

20. Next, pick n (name) with SeqScan (1.4M rows after filter). Join ci (6M) with n on person_id:

21. Join (rt ci) with n as HashJoin. Since n is 1.4M rows, and ci is 6M, but after joining on n.id = ci.person_id, the result would be ci rows where the person has gender NULL. Assuming that the 1.4M names are a subset, the resulting rows could be 6M * (1.4M / 4.1M original names) â‰ˆ 6M * 0.34 â‰ˆ 2.04M rows. But this is still a large number.

This subtree ( (rt ci) n ) has ~2M rows. Now, this needs to be joined with the existing subtree which includes t. Since ci is linked to t via movie_id (ci.movie_id = t.id). So:

22. Join the existing large subtree ((((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2))) with ( (rt ci) n ) on t.id = ci.movie_id. This would be a massive join if done at this stage. The left subtree has, say, 470 rows (from t), and the right subtree has 2M rows. Joining on t.id = ci.movie_id would result in 470 rows (each t row joined with ci rows where movie_id matches). But if each t has multiple ci entries, it could be more. But since the left side is small, a HashJoin on t.id would be manageable.

So step 22: Join the two subtrees with HashJoin.

Finally, after all these joins, the remaining tables would be handled. Wait, but what about the order? Let me check if all tables are covered:

Tables: t, kt, it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, mk, k.

After the steps above, all tables are picked and joined except perhaps none. Wait, let's count:

- k is picked in step 1.

- mk in step 2.

- t in step 5.

- kt in step7.

- it1 in step9.

- mi1 in step10.

- it2 in step13.

- mi2 in step14.

- rt in step17.

- ci in step18 (as part of join with rt).

- n in step20.

Yes, all tables are covered.

Now, let's structure this into the required action sequence, adhering to the restrictions:

Each table must be picked before being joined. So for each table, we have a Pick action.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Pick k as SeqScan.

2. Pick mk as IndexScan (assuming an index on keyword_id).

3. Join k and mk with HashJoin.

4. Check remaining tables: t, kt, it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n.

5. Decide not to divide (since the remaining tables can be tackled in order).

6. Pick t as SeqScan.

7. Join (k mk) with t as HashJoin.

8. Check remaining tables: kt, it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n.

9. Decide not to divide.

10. Pick kt as SeqScan.

11. Join ((k mk) t) with kt as HashJoin.

12. Check remaining tables: it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n.

13. Decide not to divide.

14. Pick it1 as SeqScan.

15. Pick mi1 as IndexScan.

16. Join it1 and mi1 as HashJoin.

17. Join ((...kt) with (it1 mi1) as HashJoin on t.id = mi1.movie_id.

Wait, need to make sure the join order is correct. Let's see:

After step 11, the subtree is (((k mk) t) kt). Then, we need to join this with (it1 mi1). So:

17. Join (((k mk) t) kt) with (it1 mi1) as HashJoin (on t.id = mi1.movie_id).

Then check remaining tables: mi2, it2, ci, rt, n.

Continuing:

18. Pick it2 as SeqScan.

19. Pick mi2 as IndexScan.

20. Join it2 and mi2 as HashJoin.

21. Join the existing subtree with (it2 mi2) as HashJoin (on t.id = mi2.movie_id).

22. Check remaining tables: ci, rt, n.

23. Decide not to divide.

24. Pick rt as SeqScan.

25. Pick ci as SeqScan (no filter, but after joining with rt).

26. Join rt and ci as HashJoin.

27. Pick n as SeqScan.

28. Join (rt ci) with n as HashJoin.

29. Join the existing subtree with ((rt ci) n) as HashJoin on t.id = ci.movie_id.

30. Check remaining tables: none.

But this is a rough outline. Let me ensure that each step follows the restrictions: tables must be picked before being joined, and each join combines two subtrees or tables.

Alternatively, maybe the correct order is:

- Start with the smallest filtered tables and build up.

But let's try to write the exact steps as per the example format.

Another consideration: in the example, they joined name and cast_info first, then title, etc. So maybe the order here should start with the larger tables that have filters but are still big, like name n (1.4M) and cast_info ci (36M). But joining them would be expensive. However, if we can reduce ci early by joining with rt (2 rows), that would help.

Alternative approach:

1. Pick rt (2 rows) as SeqScan.

2. Pick ci (36M) as SeqScan (no filter), but joining with rt reduces it to 6M.

3. Join rt and ci as HashJoin.

4. Pick n (1.4M) as SeqScan.

5. Join (rt ci) with n as HashJoin (assuming ci.person_id = n.id), resulting in 2M rows.

6. Then join this with t (450k) on ci.movie_id = t.id.

But this would result in 2M rows joined with t, which could be expensive. Alternatively, if t is joined early with other filtered tables, reducing its size first.

But considering the previous approach with k and mk first seems better because it reduces mk to 470 rows, which when joined with t, reduces t to 470 rows. Then subsequent joins are much smaller.

So let's proceed with that approach, translating into the required action steps.

Step-by-step actions:

1. Pick table k, with a label "SeqScan". (Because it's 14 rows, small enough for SeqScan.)

2. Pick table mk, with a label "IndexScan". (Assuming an index on mk.keyword_id to quickly find the 14 keywords.)

3. Join table k and mk as (k mk), with a label "HashJoin". (HashJoin is efficient here because k is small.)

4. Check remaining tables and subtrees: t, kt, it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, (k mk).

5. Decide not to divide the candidate table set into two subsets, tackle them recursively.

6. Pick table t, with a label "SeqScan". (Filtered to 450k rows.)

7. Join subtree (k mk) with table t as ((k mk) t), with a label "HashJoin". (Joining on mk.movie_id = t.id.)

8. Check remaining tables and subtrees: kt, it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, ((k mk) t).

9. Decide not to divide.

10. Pick table kt, with a label "SeqScan". (3 rows.)

11. Join subtree ((k mk) t) with kt as (((k mk) t) kt), with a label "HashJoin". (On t.kind_id = kt.id.)

12. Check remaining tables and subtrees: it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, (((k mk) t) kt).

13. Decide not to divide.

14. Pick table it1, with a label "SeqScan". (1 row.)

15. Pick table mi1, with a label "IndexScan". (Filter on info_type_id=8 and info in list; IndexScan on those columns.)

16. Join table it1 and mi1 as (it1 mi1), with a label "HashJoin". (On mi1.info_type_id = it1.id.)

17. Join subtree (((k mk) t) kt) with (it1 mi1) as ((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)), with a label "HashJoin". (On t.id = mi1.movie_id.)

18. Check remaining tables and subtrees: mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, ((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)).

19. Decide not to divide.

20. Pick table it2, with a label "SeqScan". (1 row.)

21. Pick table mi2, with a label "IndexScan". (Filter on info_type_id=6 and info in Mono/Silent.)

22. Join table it2 and mi2 as (it2 mi2), with a label "HashJoin".

23. Join subtree (((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) with (it2 mi2) as (((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2)), with a label "HashJoin". (On t.id = mi2.movie_id.)

24. Check remaining tables and subtrees: ci, rt, n, (((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2)).

25. Decide not to divide.

26. Pick table rt, with a label "SeqScan". (2 rows.)

27. Pick table ci, with a label "SeqScan". (No filter, but will join with rt.)

28. Join table rt and ci as (rt ci), with a label "HashJoin". (On ci.role_id = rt.id.)

29. Pick table n, with a label "SeqScan". (1.4M rows.)

30. Join subtree (rt ci) with n as ((rt ci) n), with a label "HashJoin". (On ci.person_id = n.id.)

31. Join subtree ((((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2)) with ((rt ci) n) as (((((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2)) ((rt ci) n)), with a label "HashJoin". (On t.id = ci.movie_id.)

32. Check remaining tables and subtrees: none.

But I need to ensure that each step follows the restrictions: after each join, check remaining tables and decide whether to divide. Also, ensure that all tables are picked exactly once.

Let me verify the sequence:

- Tables picked: k, mk, t, kt, it1, mi1, it2, mi2, rt, ci, n. That's 11 tables, which matches the input.

Each table is picked once, then joined.

But in the example, after each join, they check remaining tables and decide whether to divide. So after each join, there's a Check and Decide step.

So the correct sequence would alternate between Pick, Join, Check, Decide.

Let me try to structure this properly:

1. Pick k as SeqScan.

2. Pick mk as IndexScan.

3. Join k and mk as HashJoin â†’ (k mk).

4. Check remaining: t, kt, it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, (k mk).

5. Decide not to divide.

6. Pick t as SeqScan.

7. Join (k mk) with t â†’ ((k mk) t) via HashJoin.

8. Check remaining: kt, it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, ((k mk) t).

9. Decide not to divide.

10. Pick kt as SeqScan.

11. Join ((k mk) t) with kt â†’ (((k mk) t) kt) via HashJoin.

12. Check remaining: it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, (((k mk) t) kt).

13. Decide not to divide.

14. Pick it1 as SeqScan.

15. Pick mi1 as IndexScan.

16. Join it1 and mi1 â†’ (it1 mi1) via HashJoin.

17. Join (((k mk) t) kt) with (it1 mi1) â†’ ((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) via HashJoin.

18. Check remaining: mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, ((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)).

19. Decide not to divide.

20. Pick it2 as SeqScan.

21. Pick mi2 as IndexScan.

22. Join it2 and mi2 â†’ (it2 mi2) via HashJoin.

23. Join (((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) with (it2 mi2) â†’ ((((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2)) via HashJoin.

24. Check remaining: ci, rt, n, ((((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2)).

25. Decide not to divide.

26. Pick rt as SeqScan.

27. Pick ci as SeqScan.

28. Join rt and ci â†’ (rt ci) via HashJoin.

29. Pick n as SeqScan.

30. Join (rt ci) with n â†’ ((rt ci) n) via HashJoin.

31. Join (((((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2)) with ((rt ci) n) â†’ final join via HashJoin.

32. Check remaining: none.

But the example shows that after each join, there's a Check and Decide step. However, in the example, after joining two tables, they Check and Decide, then proceed.

In our case, after joining k and mk, we Check and Decide, then proceed to join with t. So the sequence would be:

Action list:

1. Pick table k, with a label "SeqScan".

2. Pick table mk, with a label "IndexScan".

3. Join table k and mk as (k mk), with a label "HashJoin".

4. Check remaining tables and subtrees: t, kt, it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, (k mk).

5. Decide not to divide the candidate table set into two subsets, and tackle each of them recursively.

6. Pick table t, with a label "SeqScan".

7. Join subtree (k mk) with table t as ((k mk) t), with a label "HashJoin".

8. Check remaining tables and subtrees: kt, it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, ((k mk) t).

9. Decide not to divide.

10. Pick table kt, with a label "SeqScan".

11. Join subtree ((k mk) t) with kt as (((k mk) t) kt), with a label "HashJoin".

12. Check remaining tables and subtrees: it1, mi1, mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, (((k mk) t) kt).

13. Decide not to divide.

14. Pick table it1, with a label "SeqScan".

15. Pick table mi1, with a label "IndexScan".

16. Join table it1 and mi1 as (it1 mi1), with a label "HashJoin".

17. Join subtree (((k mk) t) kt) with (it1 mi1) as ((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)), with a label "HashJoin".

18. Check remaining tables and subtrees: mi2, it2, ci, rt, n, ((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)).

19. Decide not to divide.

20. Pick table it2, with a label "SeqScan".

21. Pick table mi2, with a label "IndexScan".

22. Join table it2 and mi2 as (it2 mi2), with a label "HashJoin".

23. Join subtree (((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) with (it2 mi2) as (((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2)), with a label "HashJoin".

24. Check remaining tables and subtrees: ci, rt, n, ((((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2)).

25. Decide not to divide.

26. Pick table rt, with a label "SeqScan".

27. Pick table ci, with a label "SeqScan".

28. Join table rt and ci as (rt ci), with a label "HashJoin".

29. Pick table n, with a label "SeqScan".

30. Join subtree (rt ci) with n as ((rt ci) n), with a label "HashJoin".

31. Join subtree (((((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2)) with ((rt ci) n) as ((((((((k mk) t) kt) (it1 mi1)) (it2 mi2)) ((rt ci) n)), with a label "HashJoin".

32. Check remaining tables and subtrees: none.

But the example uses "Check remaining tables and subtrees" after each join. So after every join step, there's a Check and Decide. However, in the example, after joining n and ci, they Check and see remaining tables, then proceed.

But in our case, after step 3 (joining k and mk), we Check and Decide. Then proceed to pick t and join. Then Check again, etc.

This sequence seems correct, but I need to ensure that each step follows the required actions.
