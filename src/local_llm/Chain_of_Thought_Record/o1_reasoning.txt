Mapping the tables

I'm piecing together the given tables, including titles, kinds, info_types, and various types of movie_info, along with their corresponding cardinalities.

Setting the stage

I’m outlining the table cardinalities and criteria, including info_types, movie_info, and keywords, to comprehensively understand the data relationships and prepare for an efficient query plan.

Crafting the plan

I’m working through a query plan, beginning with the smallest or most restrictive table. Evaluating scan and join methods, I’ve decided on a bushy or linear sequence to streamline execution.

Implementing scanning strategies

I’m noting the selection of IndexScan for smaller tables with specific filters, like it1 and it2, to ensure efficient query execution, aligning with the example's approach.

Choosing scan strategies

I'm opting for SeqScan for filters/tiny tables or IndexScan if indexes exist. For larger tables, like mi1 and t, IndexScan is the go-to choice.

Mapping the strategy

For sizeable tables like n and mk, I’m leaning towards IndexScan with specific filters. Without filters, a general SeqScan or IndexScan approach is recommended.

Crafting the plan

I'm beginning with smaller tables having filters, using IndexScan for optimal results. Following this, I'll join these tables and proceed in alignment with the example's step-by-step approach.

Aligning the chain

I’m linking tables with appropriate joins: starting with NestLoop for smaller subsets, transitioning to HashJoin for larger structures, and ensuring the strategy remains consistent with the example's approach.

Laying out the options

I'm considering a chain approach with varied join methods for 11 tables, mindful of cardinalities and filters, mirroring the example's use of NestLoop and HashJoin.

Evaluating join strategies

I’m mapping out join methods for 11 tables, incorporating IndexScan, SeqScan, MergeJoin, and HashJoin, aligning with the example's use of varied join methods.

Advancing join approaches

OK, let's integrate IndexScan and NestLoop for mi2, MergeJoin for t, and HashJoin for n, ensuring the strategy aligns with the example's methods.

Mapping table joins

I’m laying out the plan for sequential table joins, using IndexScan and NestLoop for mk and ci, ensuring a structured sequence of steps for optimal query execution.

Charting the course

I'm noting the progression: sequentially selecting tables, joining subtrees, ensuring consistency, and keeping references clear for accurate query execution.

Crafting the plan

OK, let me see. I’m working through Sequential Scan for larger tables and focusing on specific join methods for key tables to streamline the SQL execution.

Aligning the strategy

I’m selecting tables and applying specialized join methods. Progressing methodically to enhance SQL execution, maintaining clarity at every step.

Evaluating scan techniques

Working through different table scans and joins, focusing on clarity and SQL execution. Adaptations are considered for collaborative or pressured scenarios.
